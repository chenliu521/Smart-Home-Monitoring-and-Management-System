# Smart-Home-Monitoring-and-Management-System
## Business Overview:
Home Watching Services (HWS), owned by JP Lyons, offers a unique house watching service to monitor homes, especially during off-season periods when owners are away. Serving a community where many homes are occupied only during the summer, HWS ensures the safety and maintenance of these properties throughout the year.

## Innovative Technology Use:
HWS distinguishes itself by being the first in its sector to use sensor technology. Unlike traditional house watching services that require physical checks a few times a week, HWS's sensors provide 24/7 monitoring. These sensors are designed to detect various issues such as floods, leaks, and heating failures. Upon any sensor activation, an HWS employee promptly addresses the problem onsite.

## Service Model:
Clients are charged a monthly fee for continuous monitoring. Additional charges apply for extra services necessitated by the house calls, like flood clean-up or plumbing repairs.

## Expansion and Digitalization:
Recognizing the need for expansion, JP plans to extend services to more clients in the current town and neighboring areas. A key strategy for this growth is the development of a comprehensive online application to streamline business operations.

## Proposed Online System:

Client Onboarding: Allows potential clients to sign up, input their information, and request services online. After an initial property inspection and approval, clients are activated and billed monthly.
Sensor Integration and Notifications: The system receives alerts from sensors and notifies the on-call employee. Clients are also informed of any issues./

Issue Tracking: Clients can check the status of their issues online, with updates provided by the responding employees.
Billing and Administration: Monthly billing with the flexibility to adjust charges. Admin features include managing client accounts and employee roles./

Budget and Technical Challenges:
JP has set a $250,000 budget for the website's development. Challenges include ensuring effective integration of sensor technology with the new system and managing JP's availability due to his frequent field visits./

Project Development:
An upcoming analysis session with hired analysts will further define the design and functional aspects of the project.
